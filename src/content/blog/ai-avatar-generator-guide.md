The future of avatar creation is here! Our AI Avatar Generator uses cutting-edge technology to create stunning Notion-style avatars from your photos or simple text descriptions.

## Two Powerful Modes

### Photo to Avatar

Upload any photo of yourself (or anyone!) and watch as our AI transforms it into a beautiful hand-drawn Notion-style avatar. The AI analyzes facial features, hairstyles, and accessories to create an accurate yet stylized representation.

**How it works:**

1. Navigate to the AI Generator page
2. Select "Photo to Avatar" mode
3. Upload your photo (JPG or PNG, max 2MB)
4. Click "Generate Avatar"
5. Download your new avatar!

**Tips for best results:**

- Use a clear, well-lit photo
- Face the camera directly
- Avoid photos with multiple people
- Higher resolution photos work better

### Text to Avatar

Don't have a photo? No problem! Simply describe the avatar you want, and our AI will bring it to life.

**Example prompts:**

- "A girl with glasses and long curly hair"
- "A bearded man wearing a beanie hat"
- "A person with short spiky hair and earrings"

The more specific your description, the better the results!
